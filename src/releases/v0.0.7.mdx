## Bug Fixes

- **API Routes**: Fixed an issue where API routes (like `/api/auth`) were returning 404 because `.ts` extension was missing from `pageExtensions` in `next.config.ts`.
- **Layout Structure**: Restructured app directory layout to better support release pages and avoid conflicts.
- **Login**: Resolved sign-in issues caused by inaccessible API routes.
